🌱 ROOTED Agriculture — Production Application

(formerly ROOTED Community — kept stable for users, but canonically the Food & Agriculture Vertical)

This repository powers the ONLY live, user-facing ROOTED product in the ecosystem today.

→ ROOTED Agriculture

Local food • farms • markets • vendors • events • volunteer workdays • landmarks
Seasonal & cultural discovery • safety-governed community access

✅ LIVE PRODUCTION VERTICAL

This is the only ROOTED vertical that is currently:

Publicly active

User-facing

In real production use

Backed by enforcement from rooted-core

Governed by constitutional law in rooted-platform

All other ROOTED vertical repositories
(Construction, Healthcare, Experiences, Arts & Culture, Workforce, Emergency, etc.) are:

Documentation only

Planning frameworks

Architectural & governance references

NOT live products

NOT launch promises

NOT permitted to self-define rules

This vertical is the reference implementation for all future verticals.

🧭 Governance Boundaries (IMMUTABLE)

This repository cannot define or modify governance.
It must follow, not lead, ROOTED law.

This repo:

❌ Does NOT define roles

❌ Does NOT define tiers

❌ Does NOT change access laws

❌ Does NOT define Kids Mode

❌ Does NOT modify sanctuary rules

❌ Does NOT expand admin power

❌ Does NOT alter event, volunteer, or vendor safety rules

❌ Does NOT own schema or RLS

All governance, safety, and access control live in:

rooted-platform/governance/

rooted-platform/docs/

rooted-core/docs/

UI is not law.
UI reflects law.
Only governance defines authority.

Any attempt to bypass canonical rules is automatically invalid.

🔐 Source(s) of Authority

This vertical is governed by and must obey:

🎓 Platform Constitution & Laws

rooted-platform/governance/ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md
rooted-platform/governance/ROOTED_COMMUNITY_GOVERNANCE.md
rooted-platform/governance/ROOTED_KIDS_MODE_GOVERNANCE.md
rooted-platform/governance/ROOTED_SEASONAL_CULTURAL_INTELLIGENCE_LAW.md
rooted-platform/governance/ROOTED_SECURITY_DISCOVERY_CONTRACT.md
…and all other platform-level laws.

⚙️ Backend Enforcement

rooted-core/docs/MODERATION_SYSTEM.md
rooted-core/docs/DISCOVERY_IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
rooted-core/docs/GEO_RULES.md
rooted-core/docs/NOTIFICATIONS_SYSTEM.md
…and all core enforcement engines.

This repo implements UI only within those constraints.

🌿 Purpose of This Vertical

ROOTED Agriculture serves:

Local farms

Markets

Growers

Food access programs

Seasonal workdays & volunteer events

Safe family discovery

Community-supported agriculture

Farm experiences (governance-bound for youth safety)

It is designed to:

Connect people with local food

Support small farms

Strengthen community

Educate youth safely

Drive seasonal discovery without surveillance

Provide event & volunteer access with strict safety rules

ROOTED Agriculture is slow, governed, human-first, safety-enforced, and community-rooted.

It does not chase growth.
It does not extract data.
It does not operate outside of law.

🔄 Development Reality

This repo is the only “live” canvas where ROOTED touches the public.

Every other vertical is:

In planning

Under governance review

Architecturally staged

Not promised or scheduled for public timelines

This keeps ROOTED stable, trusted, safe, and deliverable.

🌱 Final Statement

ROOTED Agriculture exists to:

Serve people

Support farms

Strengthen neighborhoods

Keep children safe

Build local trust

Reduce digital harm

Build slowly, safely, and with dignity

This repo is not a growth engine.
It is a community engine.

Governance is the north star.
Safety is the gate.
Trust is the product.
