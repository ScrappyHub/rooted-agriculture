# 🌱 ROOTED Agriculture — Production Application

This repository powers the **only live, user-facing ROOTED vertical**:

> ROOTED Agriculture & Local Food  
> (Farms, markets, sanctuaries, food education, seasonal discovery)

---

## ✅ Live Production Vertical

This is the **only** ROOTED vertical that is currently:

- Publicly active
- User-facing
- Enforced by ROOTED governance and ROOTED Core

All other vertical repos (Construction, Healthcare, Emergency, Workforce, etc.) are:

- Documentation only
- Planning frameworks
- Governance and architecture references
- **Not** active products
- **Not** launch promises

---

## 🧭 Governance Boundaries

This repository:

- ❌ Does **not** define roles, tiers, or access laws  
- ❌ Does **not** modify database schema or RLS  
- ❌ Does **not** define Kids Mode rules  
- ❌ Does **not** define sanctuary protections  
- ❌ Does **not** define admin authority  
- ❌ Does **not** define core marketplace behavior  

ALL governance and access control live in:

- `rooted-platform/governance/`
- `rooted-core/docs/`

Any change that attempts to bypass ROOTED governance is invalid by design.

---

## 🔐 Source of Authority

ROOTED Agriculture **must obey** all rules defined in:

- `rooted-platform/governance/`  
- `rooted-platform/docs/`  
- `rooted-core/docs/`

UI is **never** a source of truth.  
UI only reflects law — it does not create it.

ROOTED Agriculture exists to serve **trust, food, families, and local discovery**.

It does **not** exist to expand power.  
It does **not** exist to extract data.  
It does **not** exist to chase growth.

Slow, governed, and human is the product.
