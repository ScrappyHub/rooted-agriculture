## Governance Boundaries

This repository:

- Does NOT define roles, tiers, or access laws
- Does NOT change database schema or RLS
- Does NOT define Kids Mode or sanctuary rules

All governance and access control lives in:

→ https://github.com/.../rooted-platform

Any change that attempts to bypass ROOTED governance is invalid by design.
