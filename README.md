# ROOTED Community — Production Application

This repository powers the ONLY live, user-facing ROOTED product.

→ ROOTED Community  
(Local food, vendors, events, landmarks, seasonal & cultural discovery)

---

## ✅ LIVE PRODUCTION VERTICAL

This is the only ROOTED vertical that is currently:

- Publicly active
- User-facing
- In real production use

All other ROOTED vertical repositories (Construction, Healthcare, Emergency, Workforce, etc.) are:

- Documentation only
- Planning frameworks
- Governance and architecture references
- NOT active products
- NOT public launch promises

---

## 🧭 Governance Boundaries

This repository:

- ❌ Does NOT define roles, tiers, or access laws
- ❌ Does NOT modify database schema or RLS
- ❌ Does NOT define Kids Mode rules
- ❌ Does NOT define sanctuary protections
- ❌ Does NOT define admin authority

ALL governance and access control lives in:

→ rooted-platform  
→ rooted-core

Any change that attempts to bypass ROOTED governance is invalid by design.

---

## 🔐 Source of Authority

This application **must obey all rules defined in**:

- rooted-platform/governance/
- rooted-platform/docs/
- rooted-core/docs/

UI is never a source of authority.
UI only reflects law — it does not create it.

## ✅ Allowed Work Here

ROOTED Community exists to serve trust, food, families, and local discovery.

It does not exist to expand power.
It does not exist to extract data.
It does not exist to chase growth.

Slow, governed, and human is the product.
