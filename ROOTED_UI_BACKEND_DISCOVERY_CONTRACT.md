# ROOTED — UI ↔ Backend Discovery Contract (Reference Only)

The canonical UI ↔ Backend discovery contract **does not live in this repo.**  
It is defined centrally in:

`rooted-platform/governance/contracts/ROOTED_UI_BACKEND_DISCOVERY_CONTRACT.md`

ROOTED Agriculture **must obey** that contract for:

- Vendor discovery rows
- Seasonal discovery panels
- Landmark discovery
- Any “Recommended for you” style surfaces

If this repo appears to diverge from the contract → the contract in `rooted-platform` wins.
